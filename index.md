**I am a fan of Python, but have dabbled in C/C++/Java/Ruby/Clojure.**

>Which is not, to say, that I'm any good at any of them. For example, would you like a cursed pomodoro?

```python
from time import sleep

while True: [eval(_) for _ in ["print('work!\a')", "sleep(25*60)", "print('rest!\a\a')", "sleep(5*60)"]]
```
